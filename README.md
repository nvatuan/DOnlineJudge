# DOJ - DOnlineJudge (v1.0)
A modern online judge that is developed using ReactJS and Django REST API Framework. Our motive is To further understand about Online Judges, so, albeit taking some inspirations and ideas from other OJ, we have built our own OJ, taking a different approach than others.

See it in action [here](http://45.117.171.223:8080/).

## Features
The current version consists of a small set of functionality, though very necessary and allows us to demonstrate the core features our system can do.

* A bulletin board to post announcements
* Rich problem statements, with support for LaTeX math
* Support popular programming language: `C, C++, Python, Java`
* Rich, comprehensive submission status page
* Great Permission controls for staffs
